# 🚀 Qelem Release Build - Quick Guide

## 📱 Generate AAB for Google Play

**Option 1 – EAS Build (recommended, cloud build)**  
Run in your terminal (interactive; first time will prompt for Android credentials):

```bash
npx eas build --platform android --profile production
```

- Sign in to Expo when prompted.
- If asked, choose “Generate new Android keystore” (EAS will store it).
- When the build finishes, download the AAB from the link in the terminal or from [expo.dev](https://expo.dev).
- Upload that `.aab` file in Google Play Console → Your app → Production (or testing track) → Create new release.

**Option 2 – Local AAB build**  
Requires the release keystore at `android/keystore/qelem-release-key.keystore`:

```bash
make aab
# or: make release-aab   # clean + aab
```

- **Output:** `android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`
- Upload `app-release.aab` in Google Play Console as above.

*(Gradle has been updated to 8.13 for local builds.)*
