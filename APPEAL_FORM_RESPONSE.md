# Google Play Appeal Form - Response Text

## Recommended Option: "I believe this is incorrect"

### Description Field (1000 character limit):

```
Qelem is an educational app for Ethiopian students providing MCQ questions, flashcards, and homework assistance. We believe the removal is incorrect because:

1. TARGET API LEVEL: We target API Level 35, fully compliant with requirements.

2. CHILD SAFETY: We are an educational-only app with no social features, user-generated content sharing, or user-to-user communication. Our Privacy Policy (https://qelem.net/privacy-policy) addresses children's privacy. We have reporting mechanisms and are committed to implementing any additional child safety measures required.

3. AI CONTENT: We use AI responsibly for educational homework help only, with content filtering and in-app reporting features. We prohibit generation of restricted content.

4. PERMISSIONS: Camera permission is used ONLY for homework assistance (taking photos of homework questions), clearly documented in our Privacy Policy. We do not store or share photos without consent.

We are willing to enhance our policies and reporting mechanisms to exceed requirements, but we believe we are fundamentally compliant. Please see our detailed appeal letter for full compliance documentation.
