## Subject: Appeal for App Reinstatement - Policy Compliance Clarification

Dear Google Play Review Team,

I am writing to appeal the removal of my educational application "Qelem" from Google Play. I believe there has been a misunderstanding regarding policy compliance, and I would like to provide clarification and demonstrate our commitment to full compliance with all Google Play policies.

**About Qelem:**
Qelem is an educational platform designed exclusively for Ethiopian students to enhance their learning through interactive educational content including multiple-choice questions, flashcards, quizzes, and homework assistance. Our app serves students from kindergarten through grade 12, focusing solely on educational content delivery.
